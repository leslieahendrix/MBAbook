# person_id  is key
# treatment is in Description file, and is random conditional on the numhh_list (number of names in lottery)
# in 2008 new spots opened for medicaid, which was previously closed to new enroll
# we are interested in health insurance effect on increased costs and utilization (on health is longer term)
# admin data is clean, survey data not necessarily balanced due to non-response bias
# admin data has hospital admission (by dept, emerg itself is non-signif)
# we can also look at number of hostpital days or total list cost
